  # --- 🔹 Nuevas FAQs sobre UV DTF ---
  utter_faq/uv_what_is:
  - custom:
      type: "grid"
      text: |
        **UV DTF** is a bit different! It's used for applying designs to **hard, non-fabric surfaces**.
        
        Think of it for things like:
        * Glass cups or mugs
        * Phone cases
        * Laptops
        * Keychains
        * Metal or plastic
        
        It's a permanent sticker/transfer that you apply by hand, no heat press needed!
      options:
      - title: "What materials?"
        payload: '/faq/uv_materials'
      - title: "Use on a shirt?"
        payload: '/faq/uv_vs_dtf_shirts'

  utter_faq/uv_materials:
  - text: "UV DTF works on almost any hard, smooth surface! This includes glass, metal, plastic, acrylic, wood, and ceramic. It's not designed for fabric or soft, flexible materials."

        **No, you cannot use UV DTF on a shirt** or any fabric. 
        
        The UV transfer is a type of hard, permanent sticker and will crack and peel off flexible fabric.
        
        For all fabrics (cotton, polyester, blends), you need to use our **regular DTF Transfers**.

      - title: "What is regular DTF?"
