        **UV DTF** is a bit different! It's used for applying designs to **hard, non-fabric surfaces**.
        
        Think of it for things like:
        * Glass cups or mugs
        * Phone cases
        * Laptops
        * Keychains
        * Metal or plastic
        
        It's a permanent sticker/transfer that you apply by hand, no heat press needed!
